  <h2>Welcome to the CDF API Documentation</h2>
  <h3>Some Links to Get Started</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>If you're interested in details about the Dashboard objects, start in the {@link cdf.dashboard.Dashboard|Dashboard} class. From
      there you can jump to the specific classes and their details.</li>
    
      <li>If you want to review the methods for the base component classes, start {@link cdf.components|here}.
      This module defines the {@link cdf.components.BaseComponent|BaseComponent} class (from where all other components inherit) 
      and the {@link cdf.components.UnmanagedComponent|UnmanagedComponent} (from where most of the default components inherit).</li>
    
      <li>If you want to know more about the component lifecycle, there's a good write up about the Unmanaged lifecycle
      {@link cdf.components.UnmanagedComponent|here}. For other documentation about the subject, in your Pentaho installation,
      navigate to Plugin Samples <code>-&gt;</code> CDF <code>-&gt;</code> Documentation <code>-&gt;</code> lifecycle and also Plugin Samples <code>-&gt;</code> CDF <code>-&gt;</code> Documentation <code>-&gt;</code> concepts.</li>
    
      <li>If you want to know about all existing CDF components and their properties, that's also available in your Pentaho installation.
      Navigate to Plugin Samples <code>-&gt;</code> CDF <code>-&gt;</code> Require Samples <code>-&gt;</code> Documentation <code>-&gt;</code> Component Reference <code>-&gt;</code> Core Components. There's a sample and a property listing for all of them there.</li>
  </ul>
